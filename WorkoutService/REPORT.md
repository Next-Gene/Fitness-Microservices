## 2. Feature Folders

The business logic is organized into feature folders within `WorkoutService/Features/`. This follows the **Vertical Slice Architecture** pattern.

*   **/Features/Shared:** Contains shared classes used across multiple features, such as `RequestResponse<T>`, `EndpointResponse<T>`, and `PaginatedResult<T>`.
*   **/Features/Workouts/GetAllWorkouts:** Contains all logic for fetching a paginated list of all workouts.
*   **/Features/Workouts/GetWorkoutDetails:** Contains the logic for fetching the full details of a single workout.
*   **/Features/Workouts/GetWorkoutsByCategory:** Contains the logic for fetching workouts filtered by a specific category.
*   **/Features/Workouts/StartWorkoutSession:** Contains the logic for a user to start a new workout session.

## 3. API Endpoints

The following API endpoints have been implemented in the `WorkoutService`:

| Method | Endpoint                                   | Description                                                        |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/workouts`                         | Retrieves a paginated list of all workouts with optional filters.  |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/workouts/{id}`                    | Retrieves the detailed information for a single workout by its ID. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/workouts/category/{categoryName}` | Retrieves a paginated list of workouts belonging to a category.    |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/workouts/{id}/start`              | Starts a new workout session for the authenticated user.           |

## 5. Endpoint Implementation Strategy

The implementation of each endpoint follows a consistent and modern architectural pattern to ensure the code is decoupled, maintainable, and easy to test.

### Core Concepts:

1.  **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
    The pattern separates read and write operations.
    *   **Queries:** Used for read operations. They fetch data and shape it for the client but do not change the state of the system. (e.g., `GetAllWorkoutsQuery`).
    *   **Commands:** Used for write operations. They are responsible for changing the state of the system (e.g., creating, updating, deleting data). (e.g., `StartWorkoutSessionCommand`).

2.  **Vertical Slice Architecture:**
    Instead of organizing code by technical layers (e.g., `Controllers`, `Services`, `Repositories`), we organize it by feature. Each feature folder (or "slice") is self-contained and holds all the code it needs to function. A typical slice includes:
    *   The **Command** or **Query** record.
    *   The **Handler** class that contains the business logic.
    *   Associated **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) or **ViewModels**.
    *   The **Endpoint** definition file.

3.  **MediatR Library:**
    MediatR is the glue that makes this pattern work. It is a simple mediator implementation that allows us to send a Command or Query object from our endpoint and have it dispatched to the correct Handler without the endpoint needing to know which handler exists or where it is. This keeps the endpoint thin and focused on HTTP concerns.

### How a Request is Processed (Step-by-Step):

1.  **Endpoint Definition (`Endpoints.cs`):** An incoming HTTP request (e.g., `GET /api/v1/workouts`) is mapped to a specific Minimal API endpoint. This endpoint's only job is to:
    a. Create the appropriate **Query** or **Command** object with data from the request (e.g., route parameters, query strings, request body).
    b. Use MediatR to `mediator.Send()` the object.
    c. Receive the result from the handler.
    d. Map the result to a standardized `EndpointResponse` and return it as an HTTP response (e.g., `Results.Ok()` or `Results.BadRequest()`).

2.  **Handler (`Handlers.cs`):** MediatR routes the Command/Query to its corresponding Handler. The Handler contains the core business logic and is responsible for:
    a. Receiving the request object.
    b. Interacting with the database via injected repositories (`IBaseRepository<T>`).
    c. Performing any necessary business logic, validation, or data mapping.
    d. Returning the result wrapped in a standardized `RequestResponse<T>`, which indicates success or failure and contains the data or an error message.
